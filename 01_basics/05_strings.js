//Yes! ðŸŽ¯ The String object in JavaScript comes packed with built-in methods and properties that are specifically designed for string manipulation â€” and they work whether you use a string object (new String()) or a primitive string ("text"), because JS automatically wraps primitive strings with a temporary String object when needed (this is called autoboxing).
