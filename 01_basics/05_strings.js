//Yes! ðŸŽ¯ The String object in JavaScript comes packed with built-in methods and properties that are specifically designed for string manipulation â€” and they work whether you use a string object (new String()) or a primitive string ("text"), because JS automatically wraps primitive strings with a temporary String object when needed (this is called autoboxing).

const name2 = "        Yatharth  "
console.log(name2)
console.log(name2.trim())

const url = "Yatharth%20Saluja"
console.log(url.replace("%20","-"));
console.log(url)

// strings are immutable , hence proved
